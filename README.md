# Code to Cloud

## _An interactive web essentials build-along!_

**Get involved in the build-along by contributing your own party invitation theme!**

To do this...

1. Fork the repo
2. create a new project in VS Code using the link from your new fork
3. Add a new template named "invite-<WHATEVER YOUR THEME IS CALLED>.html"
   Feel free to copy mine as as a base, and rearrange any elements you like.
   Just make sure you have the following placeholders (and no others):

- {{ to }}
- {{ event_name }}
- {{ date }}
- {{ time }}
- {{ sender }}

4. Create a new CSS file to style your html. Don't forget to link it in the HTML head.
5. Work on your files until you're happy!
6. Commit your files to your fork.
7. Push your fork
8. From your fork's repo on github.com create a pull request so I can see your code and add it to core codebase.

I look forward to seeing your designs!
Yay!
